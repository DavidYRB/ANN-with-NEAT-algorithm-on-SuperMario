# ANN-with-NEAT-algorithm-on-SuperMario
Implementing NEAT to find ANN structure used for SuperMario

This repo is used for implementing NeuroEvolution of Augmenting Topologies (NEAT) algorithm to find a relative optimal ANN strucure. The artificial neural network is used for training SuperMario to finish stage 1-1 in MATLAB.
